# Standardizing field testing for ApRES systems across the polar regions
Conceived at a workshop in 2022 (Columbia/U Maine/Dartmouth), we propose a suite of standardized tests that anyone deploying an ApRES can make.


This work is in progress. If you have any tests you'd like to add to this suite, please submit an issue or fill out this Google form (tbd). If you are deploying an ApRES and can make these measurements, please get in touch!
